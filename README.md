This wine project was just an interest of mine as a large of my family and friends are avid wine enthusiats. Their passion led me to explore the world of wine more deeply. With wine's health benefits and worldwide consumption, with over 22.1 billion liters drank during 2023, I saw this as a great opportunity to analyze what the wine market is like.

For this project, I used a dataset from Kaggle containing details about various wines, including the winery, type, country and region of origin, ratings, price, and descriptions. My goal was to explore the wine market and gain insights into different wine varieties. I hope you find this analysis as insightful as I did.
